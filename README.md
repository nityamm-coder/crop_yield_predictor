# crop_yield_predictor
This project uses ANN to classify the crop yield &amp; environmental conditions based on parameters, using the government historical data

The ANN-based Crop Yield Indicator successfully demonstrates the application of artificial intelligence in agriculture. The system accurately predicts crop yield and classifies it into meaningful categories, supporting data-driven decision-making for farmers and agricultural stakeholders. Achieving an accuracy of 84.5%, the model proves the effectiveness of ANN techniques for yield prediction.
